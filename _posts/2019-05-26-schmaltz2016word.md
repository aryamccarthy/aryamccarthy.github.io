## Problem

The problem is pretty straightforward. You're given the words and punctuation of a sentence, scrambled. Instead of "*Papa ate the caviar with a spoon .*", you get "*. ate with the a caviar spoon Papa*"[^a]â€”utterly unintelligible. The challenge is to rediscover the original order. 

What makes this challenging is that a sentence of \\(N\\) words has \\(N!\\) possible arrangements. It's NP-hard to evaluate each arrangement individually by brute force, to identify the highest quality.
