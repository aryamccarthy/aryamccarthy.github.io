We're now up and kicking with an RSS feed! Thanks to [Tongfei Chen](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~tongfei/) for the tip. It's easy to add an RSS feed to sites created with GitHub Pages (like mine) using [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/atom-rss-feeds-for-github-pages/). You can now subscribe to this page using your favorite RSS reader. (Does anyone have a favorite? I'm on the market.)
