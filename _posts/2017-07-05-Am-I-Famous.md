In the span of one week, I've now gotten three emails related to my work on graphs and complex networks. I have no idea how people found me, since I strive for a quiet life.

1. Someone wrote asking for the [code](https://github.com/aryamccarthy/thesis) from my [thesis](https://search.proquest.com/openview/afef8e23a074a436f0e25d8a7021feb8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), which to that point had only been online for a week.
2. I've been invited to a conference in Lyon—yippee! But, like, how did I get added to a complex networks mailing list? Fingers crossed that Hopkins will pay for me to go to conferences unrelated to my Hopkins work.
3. Someone asked *my* permission to contribute to [`networkx`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx). This one makes a bit more sense to me. 
  
  A master's student sent the email asking whether he could contribute his thesis algorithm for generating a particular type of random geometric graph to `networkx`. Since I contributed the fast, _k_-d tree-based generator for random geometric graphs, I got to stick my name on the file as one of the authors. That's how *this* one found me. Still not sure about the rest…


Seems like I'm now relevant in the complex networks community.
