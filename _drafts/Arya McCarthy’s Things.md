# Arya McCarthy’s Things
Here’s a list of everything I own that sparks joy in my life, and that I would replace if stolen. Anything not on this list could be discarded.

## Electronics
* 13-inch MacBook Pro (late 2013). There haven’t been many hardware innovations in the past few years, and my heavy processing happens on the CLSP Grid. I won’t update until this laptop gives out. It stays at work to help enforce a work-life balance.
* iPhone 6S. Smartphones have stagnated, too. I don’t think wireless charging is worth the added weight and fragility. I’ve disabled the web browser in Settings→Restrictions to keep me from aimless Facebooking and Redditing.
* 9.7-inch iPad (5th generation). This is my main everything. Watching videos, spreeding, taking notes, and managing to-dos, this is the core of the operation.

## Software 
 I actually have a lot of faith in Apple defaults. Safari is a fast, energy-efficient browser. The Reading List is a great way to reduce tab overload (and therefore mental overload). Apple Maps is accurate and well-integrated. iMessage is hella secure. The things below replace them only if there’s a good reason.
* Bear. Because Notes doesn’t support Markdown. (I also use Notes, because Bear charges money to sync between devices.)
* Calm. Meditation is nice.
* Duolingo. It’s a great way to build a vocabulary in a foreign language. (I should make a post about my feelings on Duolingo.)
* Facebook Messenger app. I like the notifications, and the fact that it’s separate from Safari so I have to intentionally move into message-sending.
* Mint. Tracking my money visually is great, as is the weekly update. 
* Spark. Everything Mail should have been. It integrates with Todoist and has excellent smart clustering, so it takes seconds to reach Inbox Zero.
* Spotify. Everything Apple Music should have been, for less money. (Spotify student rate, woohoo.) Apple’s mobile Music UI is awful, which is my biggest qualm.
* Spreeder. Reading takes forever, because of our internal monologues. We read only as fast as we speak. With Spreeder, I can finish a book of a few hundred pages in an hour.
* Streaks. Ingrain those habits. 
* Time Out. Reminds me to stand up and stretch when I’ve been working for awhile.
* Todoist. Everything Reminders should have been: contexts, labels, and nesting.

## Health
* Electric kettle. Do you know how great it is to make tea in minutes without leaving your bedroom?
* Soylent. Making food decisions saps willpower. Options near campus cost too much money, and preparing meals in advance is inconvenient. I only eat solid foods when socializing or on weekends when I’m not Intermittent Fasting.
* A bicycle. My pride and joy, a 1981 Schwinn Super Le Tour. Blinking lights I use day and night.
* Eye mask. Mine was a freebie from transatlanticism; I wash it weekly.

## Clothing

## Mementos
* Small figures of Don Quijote and Sancho Panza from El Toboso, the town where Dulcinea is supposedly from. I relate way too much with Don Quijote and rely on my friends to keep me from veering off course. These and a beautiful plate were gifts from my aunt and uncle in Spain.
