Controversial opinion: **Don't run yourself ragged.**


What happens when you run out of energy? You miss out on Forbes magazine.
- In Summer 2014 I took part in a computer science summer intensive at Stanford
- One of my classes was entrepreneurship
- Wound up [in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maseenaziegler/2014/07/14/the-mind-blowing-way-selfies-will-change-our-future-yes-selfies-2/#633a4108693f)
- Except I didn't. I was napping because I'd wiped myself out on a compilers assignment the night before

## When it all went wrong

- Thesis meant 12--16 hour days. I saw my profs for the first time in a month and they pointed out that I was still in pajamas.
- Diet consisted mostly of soda and pizza bagels provided daily by my caring and long-suffering significant-other-at-the-time. (She did take a cut of the loot, though.)


## The reboot

- Summer 2017 I took my first real break in years
- Focused on health and instilling good habits
- Lost the 10 pounds I gained working on my thesis (and now I've lost the pudge I put on in the year before that). #thesisthirty
- Probably still spent too much time in bars, because what else is there to do in Dallas at night?


## It's not like this everywhere

My Danish friend Signe claims that there aren't these sleepless nights there the same way as there are in America. We seem to have a hobby of busyness.


## What I do now

- Inspired by the Gatsby Schedule
- Augmented with habit-tracking
- Soylent
- Intermittent Fasting
- Work-life separation
- Morning routine
- Mindful Browsing extension to block FB, Reddit, porn, etc. Consume only on the iPad.
