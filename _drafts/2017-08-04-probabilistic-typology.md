[Probabilistic Typology: Deep Generative Models of Vowel Inventories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.01684.pdf). Cotterell and Eisner, ACL 2017

The authors of this paper want to figure out what a natural set of vowels in a language looks like. The authors use a few increasingly complex models to predict the vowels that exist in various languages.
