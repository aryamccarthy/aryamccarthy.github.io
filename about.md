Hi, I'm Arya. I'm a B.S. candidate in computer science and mathematics, as well as an M.S. candidate in computer science (joint with the B.S.) at SMU. I am advised by [David Matula](http://lyle.smu.edu/~matula/). My research with him involves applications of the [hierarchical](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1415200) [Maximum Concurrent Flow Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem) for stable, mathematically motivated hierarchical clustering. Applications exist in social network analysis and network design. Other interests of mine are machine translation and interdisciplinary applications of computation.
