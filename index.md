Hi, I'm Arya. I help researchers see the stories in numbers.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [computer science (CS)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), affiliated with the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu). I am advised by [David Yarowsky](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/david-yarowsky/), with whom I work on low-resource translation. My research interests are [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), [machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation), and [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science). 

I completed my M.S. in CS, as well as a B.S. in CS and math, in my four years at [Southern Methodist University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Methodist_University). I [was](https://www.smu.edu/Academics/PS/Alumni/2017Alumni) a [President's Scholar](http://www.smu.edu/academics/PS), SMU's highest academic scholarship. My [thesis](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1907180434?pq-origsite=gscholar) advisor was [David Matula](http://lyle.smu.edu/~matula/). My continuing research with him involves applications of the [hierarchical](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1415200) [Maximum Concurrent Flow Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem) for stable, mathematically motivated hierarchical clustering. I conducted additional work in ubiquitous computing, computational neuroscience, security, optics, and high-energy particle physics.

### News

- 2018-07: I'll be at the [SIAM Annual Meeting](http://www.siam.org/meetings/an18/) in Portland, presenting work on clustering evaluation measures.
- 2018-05: I'm attending [MTMA 2018](http://www.statmt.org/mtma18/) at CMU, working on continued training

### More Information

In my spare time (hah), I enjoy:

- bagpiping
- ballroom dancing
- biking—I have a 1982 Schwinn Le Tour that I maintain.
- learning languages through Duolingo (currently Romanian, [rather unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Romanian) among Romance tongues)
- reading [xkcd](http://xkcd.com)—and now [PHD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com)
