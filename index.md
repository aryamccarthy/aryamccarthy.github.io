Hi, I'm Arya. (And occasionally,  <span class="tooltip">安力仁<span class="tooltiptext"> Bestowed upon me by the boundlessly clever Shuoyang Ding. <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~sding/">http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~sding/</a></span></span>.) I help researchers see the stories in numbers.

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [computer science (CS)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), affiliated with the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu).
I am advised by [David Yarowsky](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/david-yarowsky/), with whom I work on low-resource [machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation).
My research interests are [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)), and [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science). You're welcome to look at my [publications](publications).

I completed my M.S. in CS, as well as a B.S. in CS and math, in my four years at [SMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Methodist_University).
I [was](https://www.smu.edu/Academics/PS/Alumni/2017Alumni) a [President's Scholar](http://www.smu.edu/academics/PS), SMU's highest academic scholarship.
My [thesis](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1907180434?pq-origsite=gscholar) advisor was [David Matula](http://lyle.smu.edu/~matula/).
My research with him involves applications of the [hierarchical](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1415200) [Maximum Concurrent Flow Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem) for stable, mathematically motivated hierarchical clustering.
I conducted additional work in ubiquitous computing, computational neuroscience, security, optics, and high-energy particle physics.

### More Information

In my spare time (hah), I enjoy:

- bagpiping
- ballroom dancing
- biking—I have a 1982 Schwinn Le Tour that I maintain.
- learning languages through Duolingo (currently Romanian, [rather unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Romanian) among Romance tongues)
- reading [xkcd](http://xkcd.com)—and now [PHD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com)
