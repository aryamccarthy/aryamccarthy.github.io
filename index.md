Hi! I'm Arya McCarthy. I am a computer scientist, musician, cyclist, runner, and politics lover. A Texas expat, I've had the good fortune to wander before making the DC area my home. A constant drive for me is to make the communities we're a part of healthier, effective, and welcoming. I'm convinced that the impossible, the improbable, and the inevitable are separated by your grit, and I hope to bridge the new digital divide through understanding humans and their languages.

## Music

I've played the bagpipe for over a decade. Nowadays, it's a great way to social-distance. I also typeset original bagpipe compositions in LaTeX, which is criminally underestimated as a tool for bringing beauty into the world.

## Academic

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), designing [machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation) that uses [panlingual weak supervision](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.352/) with [David Yarowsky](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/david-yarowsky/) in JHU's [LoReLab](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~arya/yarowsky-lab/). I graduated from [SMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Methodist_University) in 2017 with a bachelor's in mathematics and computer science and a master's in computer science. There, I worked with [David Matula](http://lyle.smu.edu/~matula/) on convex optimization, graph theory, and number theory.

Along the way, I also studied at briefly at Stanford University and the University of Edinburgh.

This summer, I will intern at Google in New York. Previously, I have interned and published at Duolingo and Facebook.

## Beauty

[I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life.](https://thrive.davidkanigan.com/post/77573489137/i-cant-feel-anything-but-gratitude-for-every) Friends and strangers on trains have shared their tenderness with me. Whether clinging to scaffolding in bell towers, sloshing for miles through stormwater drains, mountainside sunrises in New Mexico, or jumping over filched restaurant candles for Charshanbe Suri, the world finds a way to rekindle the creative spark. The past year has left me, I hope, strong in the broken places.

For fellow graduate students, I encourage you to do one thing when you travel to conferences. Book a few extra days if you can afford it, push back your return flight, and take in the area's UNESCO World Heritage Sites and museums.
