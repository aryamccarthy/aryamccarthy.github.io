## Introduction

We focus on minimally supervised and massively multilingual techniques in machine learning and natural language processing. We apply these methods to machine translation, speech recognition, lexicon induction, and historical linguistics. We are also the core of the [Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project](http://unimorph.org).

We are led by David Yarowsky, [ACL Fellow](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/ACL_Fellows) and [Treasurer](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Officers#ACL_Officers_.281989_-_.29), [Professor](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yarowsky/) of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu), and member of the multi-departmental [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu).
